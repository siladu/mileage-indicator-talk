Note: I'm a Java developer working here, at AT

AT is a data company

A foundation of that is our data platform

Consists of an S3-backed data lake and tools to process and extract insight

---

A **well-supported data platform** can empower developers to **self-serve** and build intelligent data-driven products

---

## Storytime
1. Leaving Java comfort zone
2. Self-serving the data platform
3. Returning with data engineering knowledge

Note: I'm going to tell you about how we built a machine learning product, from a Java developer's POV

Three stages...

---

## 1. Leaving Java comfort zone

Note: I'm on a product team working on the autotrader website.

Redesign of product page, including new features.

Use our data to increase trust and transparency in the car buying experience.

## Mileage Indicator

Note: Wanted to use ML to acheive to most accurate mileage predictions we could, analyse the millions of stock items.

Java ecosystem and frontend tech, now learn machine learning and data engineering tech.

AT has DP team, they pair with product team developers to knowledge share.

Teams' priorities didn't align so would be a good test of self-service platform.

Note: Data scientist was required to write the first version of the notebook, the prototype

Notebook outputs zip file

Copy into webservice and exposed to other AT systems

Note: To give you a sense of scale, 1-1.5 millions requests per day

This data platform allows you to get trained ML pipeline serving predictions to live in a matter of days

Want to retrain

Automate, productionise, embed

## 2. Self-serving the data platform

## 3. Returning to the team with data engineering knowledge

## Recap

1. Leaving Java comfort zone
2. Self-serving the data platform
3. Returning with data engineering knowledge

A **well-supported data platform** can empower developers to **self-serve and build** intelligent data-driven products
